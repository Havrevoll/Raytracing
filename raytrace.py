import numpy as np
import ray

# define some objects
# specify a material for each object
# define some light sources
# define a window whose surface is covered with pixels
# for each pixel
#     shoot a ray towards the objects from the center of the pixel
#     compute the nearest hit point of the ray with the objects (if any)
#     if the ray hits an object
#         use the object’s material and the lights to compute the pixel color
#     else
#         set the pixel color to black
